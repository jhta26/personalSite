  whoAmI: `My name is Jason Hsu and I'm a software engineer with 2 1/2 years
  react native experience. I love building web and mobile apps and I'm
  excited to learn new technologies and frameworks. I got into tech
  because I was attracted to an industry where I could really flex my
  creative muscles. I'm attracted to the idea of going to work,
  learning as much as I can and then coming home and using what I
  learned on my own side projects. I most recently completed an
  internship for s2e consulting where I helped create a money
  management app using React Native, React.Js,Redux, Apollo GraphQL.
  Prior to that I created a mobile app called Glance that lets people
  coordinate there meetups by showing the location of all
  participants. I'm currently looking for my next step. I would love
  to join an innovative company where I could really make an impact
  with my creativity.`,

  Western Michigan University. I had to get out of the cold Michigan
  weather so I moved to San Francisco in July of 2017 to pursue a
  career in tech.`,
